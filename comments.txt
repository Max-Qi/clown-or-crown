he should add that to the wiki so we can reference it any time he does something dumb
Finally
The normies took Trav from us a while ago fellas. It‚Äôs ok for it to hurt, but it‚Äôs time we move on.
Think he's mainly talking about the clipping AMA

https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/dgmvu2/clipping_will_be_joining_rindieheads_for_an_ama/f3dsi7w
The Lost Boy, Rap or Go To The League
gotta love the ratatouille video game sample
That‚Äôs him on Costa Rica? Damn he really kills it on the whole tape
nigga posts in "theredpill" a known cuck sub
What was leaked?
Not to downplay Travis' huge success but this is definitely helped by all the merch bundles he released for the single (vinyls, cassettes, digital downloads, etc)
Fax
Amazing movie imo
he just trollin and joking around, i hope üò≥

Okay, so we didn't get one? Very different from "letting **every single AMA** slip through your finger". More like the complete opposite really.
Is there another link? or if someone downloaded it could they send it over my way ? It seems to be taken down everywhere. I was too late!
huh
This is just plain ignorant. There are absolutely standards for art. You can know something is good and not like it just as you can know something is bad and like it anyway. Liking something doesn't make it good. Not liking something doesn't make it bad. There are real objective standards for art. You're right that they aren't set; they shift and flow with the times, but the standards exist. Illmatic is a better album than Total Xanarchy because it accomplishes its goals more effectively. It aimed at being a gritty, well-told street documentary with excellent, pared down production. Xanarchy aimed to be a vibey, spaced out trip of an album, but it didn't hit that mark because it had poor production and no personality. I was comparing apples and oranges here to explain how there is better and worse, and it can depend on context.
You‚Äôre washed up
Trav is bigger
what album
Oh word so you're just ignoring the fuckton downvotes you're receiving and the upvotes everyone else is getting. Keep up the great work!
agreed but andre was a different era and those 2 have much more interesting and memorable names than guapdad 4000 (my subjective opinion). Maybe he‚Äôll prove me wrong. I‚Äôm a big fan so I‚Äôm rootin for him
That‚Äôs debatable
This thread is Ass
Yes your mother said you was, that's pretty much was mothers does.

This song is filled to the brim with quotables.
Hold my liquor probably my favorite song ever
Big ups to Alphonse Pierre who wrote this, [also he‚Äôs an excellent follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/al_peeair/status/1183122922002616321?s=21)
>Acid Rap just feels like it was Lightning in a bottle and Chance has lost that hunger he had on the come up.

100%
Give it up for highest in the room drop 27!!
I agree that it was praised, but all I'm saying is that I have seen a not insignificant and vocal group of people who think the album is trash, both online and people I know.
Lmao ok fair enough I guess I can‚Äôt argue if you‚Äôre that dedicated
Totally agree.  It's like Southernplayalistic vs atliens for some people.  There will always be people that have a nostalgic response to one over the other.  All eyez on me was such a huge deal for my age group, that I was almost in shock that there was an argument against it being Pac's best.  I don't want to suggest that it's a bad take, just that maybe I need to actually listen to more than all eyez on me and the greatest hits album lol.
>how long until yall get tired of making this same exact joke? 

imagine being so much of a boomer you don't understand memes
Definitely a stand-out track from FoG
A your mom's house joey diaz combo reference that I didn't see mentioned is when he says "email from linkenden" is from the clip of diaz saying "linkedin" that they would always play on your moms house
Fair enough.  I think I'm remembering the album slightly through rose colored glasses, knowing for damn sure I skipped a number of songs (or just listened to troublesome '96 on repeat).  I agree that, without the filler, that best songs on the 2 CD's could go against almost anything.  But unfortunately that's not the case.
Gucci released a lot of amazing albums in 2017 & 2016. Evil genius was good. His new one wasn‚Äôt even bad. Plus, the first Woptober was amazing
is it? hes only big on reddit
[your name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhQ8hLhuPY) actually reminded me how much I used to love listening to this album front to back
you have to admit its a massive step down from pinata
Did anyone actually fuck with the Wu-Tang Clan despite them explicitly telling people not to in their track "Wu-Tang Clan Aint Nuthing ta F' Wit"? Generally curious if some MCs or groups wanted to start beef or if there was perhaps any beef among Clan members themselves.

Im new to the Clan and so I apologize for my ignorance. Please educate me.
These comments are going to make me give me against the world a fresh listen on the way home tonight.  I'll report back if I remember to.
I love trav but this song is a 2 minute demo that Travis milked the fuck out of with merch bundles.
merch to boost album sales, and now merch to get a #1  
  
good for him, but this song is wack as hell
Your head is so far up your ass that you refuse to admit your rule is shit lmao. Bravo. Didn't think you corny mods' egos could get any worse.
11
*Tons* of bad AMAs.
I feel like fantano put it best. It‚Äôs sounds like if you‚Äôd tell a computer to make a Travis Scott song. It‚Äôs good but it‚Äôs nothing special.
he played a prime timeslot at most major us festivals this year (incl lolla and coachella)... he's def not only big on reddit

but yeah he's def not super huge
Or Coloring Book is a great album. I love Acid Rap but I love Coloring Book more. It's also interesting that where you were in your life affected your opinion on the album... I mostly listened to Acid Rap by myself, apart from seeing him perform it live a couple of times which was great. With Coloring Book, I was living in a foreign country and had just broken up with the girl I thought was the love of my life, so I needed something positive (Same Drugs still makes me cry). My point is, it's completely valid to love Coloring Book.
You're a shitbag, dude.
Headliner?
I thought Noname, Smino and Saba were already a group hahahah
Pardon my take. Best barstool podcast easily, one of the only ones with substance
Didn't know this song had a video. Underrated track.
Yeah like I‚Äôm kinda comparing it to Butterfly Effect, which I did think was average and boring as fuck, and Highest is way better. Honestly I think this song is better than a good chunk of songs off Astroworld. I think it‚Äôs just not out there enough for some people and for others it‚Äôs not Sicko Mode
best ‚Äúhype up‚Äù was when jpegmafia told all his fans to be disappointed. genius
Shy Ronnie is Drake on Nonstop
What are you basing the lack of quality on? I think he sounds more energetic on Coloring Book (and even some of The Big Day) than Acid Rap.
prime timeslot doesnt mean headline lol

he played at 7pm on one of the secondary stages... which is fuckin a great coachella timeslot.  if he were only poppin on reddit he woulda played at like 2pm
From my understanding, it‚Äôs posted at a different random time every day so it‚Äôll be up sooner or later
That's nice, we don't actually control how artists answer questions. Fuck you want us to do there? Can you go get some better ones?
Why not make it a collab album so i can go fully deaf?
Only time other artists hyped up a project of their friends and I think it was wsy better then I thought it'd be waa Flower Boy. I was not ready for how much I loved that album.
Bodega boys juheardd
Song

I‚Äôm high sorry
Am i the only person out there that actually enjoyed Testing...
Jesus drop it already
Not completely ignore artists like clipping when they try to do an ama would be a great start. Thanks.
im actually fine the bicycle i was on was absolutely demolished tho
Snitchy from the Nine - great diss track
I think I'd die for Monte Booker if he needed me to nbs
The Lost Tapes 2?
K, I guess we missed one, shit happens. Got any answers that aren't completely pointless?
For sure i have, but i was making a low jab, and it seems everybody got so butthurt.

I wasn't even being serious.

I've very much update on whats going on.
How?
Bitchs and bling isn't a genre dude.
Idk if it's really go out of the way to say no, just say no when asked. Noname is a lot busier these days and probably values her appearances more.
Looool as if Wiley is actually going to drop on an announced date.
cring
I'd love to get some better ones, but you'd have to make me a mod first- which we all know won't happen because your pathetic little ego wouldn't let it.
its a subgenre and a type of hiphop. 

i never even said it was a genre
Yeah, what the other guy said. I actually saw it on other artists Instagram, and saw no one had posted it yet. GQ‚Äôs gotta be 2 minutes faster next time
Coloring book wasn‚Äôt that bad but IMO blkswn, bucket list project and telefone are all arguably better
holy shit... what? you talk down about BP1 & then you say that Girls Girls Girls PART TWO is the song of note?! that really surprises me... what is it about the album you didn‚Äôt like? I can listen for the whole thing without skipping a single song... & I do that like once a month. I‚Äôm not trying to fight I just want to know your perspective about it & why you don‚Äôt like it.

> Do you guys listen to Spotify's default Rap playlists?

No but I pretty much never listen to playlists.
You don't need to be a mod to get AMAs, it really isn't relevant. You got some big ideas I guess so go get some then, show us how easy it is.
wow this did not disappoint, great interview.

them fiiiiits thoooooo that last one in black and white is sick
Tell em! Lol
Should be everyone‚Äôs dream come true, we‚Äôre just the only ones who know
G-Eazy cause features and catchy hooks

And at least g-Eazy doesn‚Äôt pretend to be deep when he isnt
yeah it‚Äôs a shame he keeps doing dumb shit cause he has a spark
> Keed is so good,‚Äù I said to her, as the ATL rapper‚Äôs DJ delivered a monologue. ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs his name?‚Äù she asked, taking a sip of Red Four Loko. ‚ÄúI just know that song from TikTok.‚Äù

Yikes.
g eazy tbh. i don't particularly like his music, but logics last few albums have been straight up terrible.
Earthgang played this in tally last night, their whole show was too lit
G- Eazy
I honestly think Britain will beat US in Olympic basketball before that happens
